CPUID v0.61.

Improve comments for bits:

CPUID function=80000008h, register=ebx, bit 12 = IBPB
Indirect branch prediction barrier

CPUID function=80000008h, register=ebx, bit 14 = IBRS
Indirect branch restricted speculation

CPUID function=80000008h, register=ebx, bit 15 = STIBP
Single thread indirect branch predictor

CPUID function=80000008h, register=ebx, bit 16 = IBRS AON
Indirect branch restricted speculation always on

CPUID function=80000008h, register=ebx, bit 17 = STIBP AON
Single thread indirect branch predictor always on

CPUID function=80000008h, register=ebx, bit 18 = IBRS PREF
Indirect branch restricted speculation is preferred method
